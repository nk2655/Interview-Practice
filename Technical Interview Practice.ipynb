    "You should write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.  \n",
    "A qualified reviewer will look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might be awesome or lackingâ€”is your solution the most efficient one possible?  \n",
